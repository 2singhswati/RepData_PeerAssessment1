## Loading and preprocessing the data

Downloading the zipped file and then unzipping the data to obtain a csv file.

```{r echo = TRUE}
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = paste0(getwd(), '/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip'), method = "curl")

unzip("repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",exdir = "data")
```

Reading the csv data into a data table 

```{r echo = TRUE}
activity_DT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculating the total number of steps taken per day.

```{r echo = TRUE}
Steps_tot <- activity_DT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
head(STeps_tot, 10)
```

Histogram of total number of steps taken each day
```{r echo = TRUE}
ggplot(Steps_tot, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.

```{r echo = TRUE}
Steps_tot[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Plotting a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r echo = TRUE}
Interval_DT <- activity_DT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 
ggplot(Interval_DT, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) + geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")
```

We will now calculate the 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps on average across all the days in the dataset:

```{r echo = TRUE}
Interval_DT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]
```


## Imputing missing values

We will calculate the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

```{r echo = TRUE}
activity_DT[is.na(steps), .N ]
```
Let's fill in all of the missing values using the median for that day in the dataset.

```{r echo = TRUE}
# Filling in missing values with median of dataset. 
activity_DT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activity_DT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```

We will now create a new dataset equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r echo = TRUE}
data.table::fwrite(x = activity_DT, file = "data/tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

Calculate the mean and the median of total number of steps taken per day with imputed 𝙽𝙰 values.

```{r echo = TRUE}
# total number of steps taken per day

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Steps_tot <- activity_DT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
# mean and median total number of steps taken per day
Steps_tot[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]
ggplot(Steps_tot, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

Above we have plotted a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day with imputed 𝙽𝙰 values.


Type of Estimate | Mean_Steps | Median_Steps
--- | --- | ---
First Part (with 𝙽𝙰 values) | 10766.19 | 10765
Second Part (filling 𝙽𝙰 values with median) | 9354.23 | 10395

## Comparing the activity patterns between weekdays and weekends

Creating a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend”, indicating whether a given date is a weekday or a weekend.

```{r echo = TRUE}
activity_DT <- data.table::fread(input = "data/activity.csv")
activity_DT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activity_DT[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
activity_DT[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activity_DT[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activity_DT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activity_DT, 10)
```

Plotting panel plot containing two time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken (y-axis), one averaged across all weekday days and the other averaged across all weekends.

```{r echo = TRUE}
activity_DT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activity_DT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 
ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=`weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
